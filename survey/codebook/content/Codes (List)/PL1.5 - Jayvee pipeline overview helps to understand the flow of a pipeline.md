[[PL1 - Pipeline Overview]]

# Description

Participants overwhelmingly describe the data pipeline overview as improving understanding of the flow of the pipeline. Here, the flow can mean the order of execution but also how data flows through the pipeline. Especially for data engineering, being aware of both source code and underlying data is important.

Negatively affecting the clarity of this overview are the interpretation blocks ([[PL3.3 - Interpretation blocks make outcome unclear|PL3.3 - Interpretation blocks make outcome unclear]]) because they are more fine granular than what the participants expect to need in a pipeline.

Because participants can understand the structure of the data pipeline so easily, they perceive Jayvee as more sequential than Python ([[PL2.1 - Sequential structure of Jayvee|PL2.1 - Sequential structure of Jayvee]]).
# Representative Quotes

> The pipeline gives a very quick overview over what happens. When the blocks are named clearly everything can be seen on one quick view. That makes the pipeline easier to understand.
- *S18*

> The initial definition of the pipeline steps gives a good overview of what is executed in which order.
- *S30*

> The names of the blocks usually indicate rather easily what the block is supposed to do. Additionally since we have a syntax that very well shows the actual flow of the pipeline (via the block -> block -> ... syntax), it also easily understandable what blocks are executed in which order. It feels very sequential, which makes the pipeline easy to read.
- *S37*

> Especially the beginning of the pipeline, where we define the whole structure once, makes it very easy to follow the pipeline through the process. Also I personally think that the structure into blocks and pipes makes it easier to understand too.
