# Description

If multiple different functions to achieve the same goal exist, understanding a data pipeline becomes harder. This is also directly mirrored on a purely syntax level with [[PL5.5 - Different syntax options for the same semantic decrease understanding|PL5.5 - Different syntax options for the same semantic decrease understanding]].

With different functions, users must be familiar with all of them or can be surprised by an approach they have not yet seen. Additionally, if two functions seem to do the same thing they can confuse users as to what their differences are. While Python already includes a large standard library, external libraries also add their own functionality, exacerbating the problem (see [[PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change|PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change]]).

Added complexity impacts novice developers more, because more previous experience is required to understand a data pipeline from source code (a reason for [[HU1.1 - Python is harder to understand without previous experience|HU1.1 - Python is harder to understand without previous experience]]).
