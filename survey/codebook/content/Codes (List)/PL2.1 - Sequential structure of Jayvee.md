# Description

Sequential structure is identified by participants as positively influencing understanding. The impression that Jayvee is sequentially structured appears to be connected to the pipeline overview that is explicitly provided ([[PL1.5 - Jayvee pipeline overview helps to understand the flow of a pipeline|PL1.5 - Jayvee pipeline overview helps to understand the flow of a pipeline]]).

The structure of one sequential flow for the data pipeline is also described as a reason for Jayvee being easier to understand for novice programmers in comparison to Python ([[HU1.1 - Python is harder to understand without previous experience|HU1.1 - Python is harder to understand without previous experience]]).
# Representative Quotes

> Jayvee is specialized to represent pipelines, which shows. The syntax is adapted to very well represent a sequential flow, which is easily readable, just by looking at it.

> In Jayvee the code is written in simple structured, from extraction to interpreter and transformation, so even a non-coder can easily get an idea about it.
