[[PL5 - Syntax|PL5 - Syntax]]
# Description

Participants positively highlight that the data pipeline code is written in human-like language and can be read like english text, which is especially important for novice programmers ([[PL5.1 - Syntax is important for novices|PL5.1 - Syntax is important for novices]]).

Both Python and Jayvee are mentioned in a positive light, to no surprise with Python generally being considered one of the easier to read general-programming languages.

An effect that contributes to the feeling of reading human language when reading Python code is that it requires comparatively few special characters (see also [[PL5.4 - Expressive and verbose syntax|PL5.4 - Expressive and verbose syntax]]]). Syntax that is not related to the data pipeline, such as import statements (see [[PL6.4 - Meta infos (e.g., imports, library names) obscure the logic of the pipeline|PL6.4 - Meta infos (e.g., imports, library names) obscure the logic of the pipeline]]) seems to have no effect on how human-like the language is perceived, potentially because these syntax elements are only found at the start of a data pipeline model.

In contrast, Jayvee makes more heavy use of special characters but seems to be equally easily readable due to how close the [[HU2.1 - Mental model of an ETL pipeline aligns with Jayvee|mental model of an ETL pipeline aligns with Jayvee]].
# Representative Quotes

> The data pipelines written in jayvee is easy to understand and easy to read as English text. It is helpful while reading the code. It really understandable and feasible.
- *S14*

> Jayvee has a very human like language, almost like pseudo code which can be immediately understood even by non-programmers in my opinion as long as they have a basic theoretic knowledge about pipelines.
- *S31*

> (Python) Easily readable, close to natural language. No unnecessary syntax.
- *S38*

> Jayvee seems to be quite less computer language syntax and more abstracted English texts for each of the block of the pipeline. Thus, making it a lot easier to understand as it is pretty much just reading exactly what is happening in the pipeline.
- *S50*
