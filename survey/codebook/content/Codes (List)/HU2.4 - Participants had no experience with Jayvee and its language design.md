# Description

Participants had little previous experience in Jayvee and, because it differs from mainstream general-purpose programming languages, its approach to modeling data pipelines. In comparison, [[HU2.3 - Participants had previous experience with Python|participants had previous experience with Python]].

Unfamiliarity with the language has negative effects on how easy it is to understand data pipelines written in it, such as difficulty parsing syntax ([[PL5.2 - Unfamiliar syntax makes understanding difficult|PL5.2 - Unfamiliar syntax makes understanding difficult]]) and language elements ([[PL6.3 - Jayvee language elements (blocks, value types, constraints) are unusual and need to be learned|PL6.3 - Jayvee language elements (blocks, value types, constraints) are unusual and need to be learned]]).

Without knowing a language well, source code can also look intimidating and unintuitive which likely slows down understanding.
