# Description

Participants indicate that Python is harder to understand if the reader does lack previous experience with the language. In contrast, Jayvee is described as intuitive and easy to learn for novices.

Previous experience in programming is explicitly mentioned as requirement to understand Python, meaning that professional software engineers will struggle much less than subject-matter experts that might lack experience with other languages.

A reason for this is the existence of complex external libraries like Pandas that must be learned and kept up to date with, see also [[PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change|PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change]].
# Representative Quotes

> Python is a little bit harder to understand for a person without any knowledge in the programming language.
- *S13*

> If you have not worked/used python before the syntax of Pandas is quite difficult even for simple operations (renaming, droping, filtering etc).
- *S31*

> I think the difference might have mostly to do with how much experience one has in programming; I think that Python might require quite some knowledge to get used to, while Jayvee is a bit easier to understand even as a person with not much programming experience.
- *S34*

> Python is less intuitive compared to Jayvee in the case data engineering pipelines. (I) found the learning curve is higher in Python to build data engineering pipeline as some one have to rely on external frameworks like pandas, and they evolve in time and developers need to keep it up.
- *S35*

> I feel like Python gives you more control and makes potential transformations easier, while jayvee looks like a simpler way to achieve data pipelining
- *S54*
