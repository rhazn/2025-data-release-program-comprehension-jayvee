# Description

The expressiveness of syntax is often mentioned, especially in relation to how [[PL5.3 - Code can be read like english text|code can be read like english text]]. In addition to syntax, expressiveness can also mean how much functionality can be described in few lines of code which is discussed at [[PL3.5 - Density of functionality effects understanding|PL3.5 - Density of functionality effects understanding]].

Python is perceived as direct and short, mainly because it does not contain "unnecessary" syntax like brackets or semicolons due to the use of significant whitespace. Participants generally mention clean syntax without many special characters in combination with easier understanding of the underlying data pipeline.

In contrast to Python, Jayvee includes many special characters and is generally described as more verbose. Despite participants generally preferring the more expressive syntax, a more verbose syntax enables Jayvee to be more self-explaining.

However, these different syntax styles can also come down just aesthetic preferences or previous experience without a clear effect on understandability or speed.
# Representative Quotes

> The syntax of Python is very clean for example with only few brackets.
- *S0*

> Sometimes the steps (in Jayvee) are too "wordy", but this is only personal preference.
- *S26*

> I think Python has the advantage that the lines of code are less sometimes, but Jayvee is more structured and self explaining.
- *S28*

> (Python is) easily readable, close to natural language. No unnecessary syntax.
- *S38*

> When I look at Jayvee I am still capable of understanding context of it, but it seems a bit ugly for me because it uses curly brackets and different unnecessary symbols in the syntax.
- *S43*

> I would say the structure of the code, in Python there is no need of any kind of cursors, only indentations are fine but with Jayvee brackets, semi colons etc. make it a difficult to code and anything missed can result in failure of the program.
- *S51*
