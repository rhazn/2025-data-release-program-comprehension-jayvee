# Description

The syntax of a language is in general important for understanding, but especially so for novice programmers.

One influence is how the code can be read like human-language (see [[PL5.3 - Code can be read like english text|PL5.3 - Code can be read like english text]]). Novice programmers that are familiar with data pipelines (e.g., subject-matter experts that are not professional programmers) can understand data pipelines much easier if they can draw from their subject-matter knowledge instead of having to understand software engineering specifics.

Another effect of syntax is on how long it takes to get familiar with a language. With a more simple syntax and less options (see [[PL5.5 - Different syntax options for the same semantic decrease understanding|PL5.5 - Different syntax options for the same semantic decrease understanding]]), continuous exposure to data pipelines can quickly improve future understanding.
# Representative Quotes

> Syntax being used. Jayvee has a very human-like language, almost like pseudocode which can be immediately understood even by non programmers in my opinion as long as they have a basic theoretic knowledge about pipelines.

> *What makes data pipelines written in Jayvee difficult/easy to understand?* The code structure and syntax makes it easy to understand.
> *What makes data pipelines written in Python difficult/easy to understand?* I have more experience with Python, so it was easy to understand the code, otherwise the Jayvee is much easier to get familiar.
