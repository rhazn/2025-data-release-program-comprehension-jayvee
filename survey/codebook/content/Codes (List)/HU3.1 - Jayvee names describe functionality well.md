# Description

Participants highlighted that names in Jayvee are chosen well, especially as [[HU3.2 - Python function names are unclear or inconsistent|python function names are unclear or inconsistent]]. 

Often, block types are mentioned meaning that users refer to elements provided by the language, not the names given to specific block instances. Without external libraries, all names in Jayvee come from a single source with a consistent style and glossary. For these reasons, a consistent naming structure from one source can improve understandability.

The names of Jayvee blocks also clearly reminded participants of steps in a data pipeline ([[HU2.1 - Mental model of an ETL pipeline aligns with Jayvee|HU2.1 - Mental model of an ETL pipeline aligns with Jayvee]]). By including names of domain-specific concepts, names in Jayvee are familiar to anyone who has worked with data or data pipelines before, even if they are novice programmers.
