[[PL5 - Syntax|PL5 - Syntax]]
# Description

Naturally, having to read a language which syntax is unfamiliar decreases understanding. This is a challenge for any new language and especially domain-specific languages that might deviate from the established conventions of mainstream general-purpose programming languages.

Problems with unknown syntax can not only occur with a new or unfamiliar language. With increasing complexity and syntactic sugar, multiple syntax options can exist that archive the same result - making it more likely that a user has not seen a specific syntax before (see [[PL5.5 - Different syntax options for the same semantic decrease understanding|PL5.5 - Different syntax options for the same semantic decrease understanding]]). Additionally, external libraries might introduce new concepts or names that mean users can not recognize the syntax used (see [[PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change|PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change]]).

In the context of our experiment, [[HU2.3 - Participants had previous experience with Python|participants had previous experience with Python]] but [[HU2.4 - Participants had no experience with Jayvee and its language design|had no experience with Jayvee and its language design]]. The unfamiliarity with the syntax of Jayvee should therefore be considered as an influencing factor to the detriment of Jayvee.

> I found the Jayvee code structure a bit difficult to understand, mostly the constraints and value type. The keywords are bit long and difficult to read when there is a limited time to perform an action. (...) (Python is) easy to read and code as the language keywords are also short. Also, we have been practicing Python and Pandas for a long lime so we are habituated with the structure and data pipeline making it more easier.
