# Description

Language documentation is an important element of being able to understand anything implemented in the language. Consequently, well written documentation must be provided before a language can see real-world use and become more than an academic prototype.

In regards to structure, documentation should ideally come from one source and follow a consistent layout to be easy to browse as [[EX1.1 - Uniform documentation structure improves speed|uniform documentation structure improves speed]].

Content users expect from documentation includes examples for common problems or how to use language elements they are looking up. Ideally, these examples or other code snippets can be ran and edited directly from the browser used to access the documentation without needing to use an editor or command line.
