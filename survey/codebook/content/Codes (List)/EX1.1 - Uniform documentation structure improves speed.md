# Description

A consistent documentation structure has a positive effect on lookup speed because users can learn where to find the information they are looking for and find it more quickly in successive attempts. 
# Representative Quotes

> The documentation of the code is different. Python has the advantage of a better or more uniform structure in the documentation. Like Parameters, Returns and Raises with clear indentations. This makes it easier or quicker to grasp the function of the code with one quick glance.
