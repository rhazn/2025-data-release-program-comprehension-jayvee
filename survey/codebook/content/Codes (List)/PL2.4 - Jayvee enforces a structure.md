# Description

Jayvee strictly enforces a structure of a data pipeline element, block definitions and the pipeline overview where blocks are connected with pipes. This is in contrast to Python (see [[PL2.5 - No clearly defined or enforced structure in Python|PL2.5 - No clearly defined or enforced structure in Python]]).

This enforced structure is identified as one of the main reasons for improved understanding of Jayvee code among participants. 

Especially for novice programmers, a consistent structure of source code makes understanding a data pipeline easier. With the structure, they can quickly learn what to look for (e.g., to scan the [[PL1 - Pipeline Overview|PL1 - Pipeline Overview]]).

Reading Jayvee models also provides a learning effect for future work with data pipelines, in contrast to the less structured Python (see [[HU2.2 - No learning effect between pipelines due to low structure|HU2.2 - No learning effect between pipelines due to low structure]]).

# Representative Quotes

> The structure: In Jayvee you are forced to give one whole pipeline description, in Python you can get away without doing this.
- *S26*

> Easy: Defined structure, esp. at the beginning as overview with the different steps.
> Big difference is the structure which Jayvee kind of enforces and developer can easily recognize.
- *S29*

> Jayvee is also pretty easy to understand because of the specific structure. 
- *S45*

> Data pipelines in Jayvee is easier to understand and write, because it is relatively fixed. So this is easier to learn and memorize for non-experienced programmers. 
- *S49*

> Its easier to prevent messy and unstructured code with using Jayvee. 
- *S55*
