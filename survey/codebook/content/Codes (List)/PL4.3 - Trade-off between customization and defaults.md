# Description

A trade-off exists between more customization options and extensive use of defaults, even though it seems to be a minor influence in our experiment. 

With a higher amount of general functionality (see [[PL4.1 - Amount of functionality Limited and General|PL4.1 - Amount of functionality Limited and General]]), more customization options are needed and increase flexibility of the language. Less customization and more defaults could make understanding easier, until it becomes unclear what happens due to implementation details being hidden (see [[PL3.1 - Hidden implementation details make understanding difficult|PL3.1 - Hidden implementation details make understanding difficult]]).
