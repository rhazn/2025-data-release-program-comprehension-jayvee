# Description

Python has a much more flexible structure than Jayvee with numerous programming approaches being possible to implement a data pipeline (from script-style top-to-bottom programs to complex object-oriented approaches, [[PL2.5 - No clearly defined or enforced structure in Python|PL2.5 - No clearly defined or enforced structure in Python]]). In contrast, [[PL2.4 - Jayvee enforces a structure|PL2.4 - Jayvee enforces a structure]] that generally aligns well with the mental model of data pipelines and is described as improving understanding ([[HU2.1 - Mental model of an ETL pipeline aligns with Jayvee|HU2.1 - Mental model of an ETL pipeline aligns with Jayvee]], [[PL2.2 - Blocks structure improves understanding|PL2.2 - Blocks structure improves understanding]]).

With the flexibility of Python (and general-purpose languages in general), any data pipeline that can be implemented in Jayvee can also be implemented - with a similar structure - in Python.

# Representative Quotes

> It does not have an 'overview' of what is done in the pipeline like it exists in Jayvee which leads to having a closer look to the functions to understand what is going to happen during the execution of the pipeline. This can get messy, especially with poor formatting/naming (I often have issues with code written by myself a few months later ;) ).

> In this very script like fashion, we have no real modularization, and only the flow of the program (code being executed top to bottom) that somewhat describes the flow of the pipeline. But it seems very cluttered and very chaotic

> Its easier to prevent messy and unstructured code with using Jayvee.
