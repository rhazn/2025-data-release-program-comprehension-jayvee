[[PL1 - Pipeline Overview]]
# Description

Without a pipeline overview, all code has to be read to understand what a pipeline does, including implementation details that might be irrelevant to get a high-level overview. This potentially leads to slower understanding and requires more detail knowledge to understand the pipeline correctly (see also [[HU1.1 - Python is harder to understand without previous experience|HU1.1 - Python is harder to understand without previous experience]]).

Without special attention, [[PL1.3 - Python does not provide a pipeline overview|PL1.3 - Python does not provide a pipeline overview]].
