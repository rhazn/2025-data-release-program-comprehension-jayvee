# Description

[[EX1.3 - Documentation affects understanding|EX1.3 - Documentation affects understanding]], so one differentiating factor on pipeline understanding was the quality difference between Jayvee and Python / Pandas documentation.

Before the experiment, we assumed the Jayvee documentation would be more helpful because it can be more focused on the smaller feature set. But, while some participants described it as more user-friendly, it was also criticized for being too short and incomplete compared to Python.

Additionally, the Python documentation was highlighted for being well structured, even though the use of multiple external libraries should hinder a consistent structure (see [[PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change|PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change]]). Because a [[EX1.1 - Uniform documentation structure improves speed|uniform documentation structure improves speed]] this will have had positive effects on how fast participants could understand the data pipelines.
# Representative Quotes

> In Jayvee everything (all blocks) are from the same source, while in Python there are many libraries with different method styles and documentation.
- *S0*

> I find the descriptions in the documentation (of Jayvee) to be lacking. For example, the textfileinterpreter has only three words as a description. If I am using Jayvee for the first time that is not going to help me understand much better.
- *S5*

> Python documentation is more understandable and more complete. There is not much examples of Jayvee code in the documentation and for new users it is hard to find what they want.
- *S9*

> The Jayvee documentation is more naive user friendly than Python for understanding the data pipelines. It's really easy to make a data pipelines using Jayvee than python.
