# Description

Users generally highlight how the limited functionality of Jayvee makes it easier to understand data pipelines compared to Python.

Especially for novice developers, more options mean that code is harder to understand which is one reason for why [[HU1.1 - Python is harder to understand without previous experience|HU1.1 - Python is harder to understand without previous experience]]. On the other hand, users point out that experienced users will have more flexibility with more functionality.

In addition to the increased complexity of using a general-purpose programming language, Python also has an extensive ecosystem of libraries commonly used in data engineering such as Pandas. These add additional complexity that can make understanding a data pipeline challenging, see [[PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change|PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change]].
# Representative Quotes

> Jayvee is more limited, so the options are limited to implement something as well which makes it easier to understand if we see a new code. 
- *S10*

> I think the structure of the Jayvee that allow us the the see relation level of the building blocks make it easier the follow but Python provides more flexible solution options for an experienced user. 
- *S17*

> (Jayvee has) not so many features -> makes it easier to unterstand (...) (Python has) so many features makes it more difficult to unterstand what the code does. 
- *S41*

> In Python, there are many varieties and different options, libraries etc, it is harder for non-experienced to grasp the essence.
