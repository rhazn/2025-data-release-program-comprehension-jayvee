[[PL5 - Syntax|PL5 - Syntax]]
# Description

Similar to how [[PL4.4 - Different functions to achieve the same goal decrease understanding|different functions to achieve the same goal decrease understanding]], multiple different syntax options to achieve the same goal will decrease understanding due to the chance of readers encountering an unfamiliar syntax construct.

Many syntax options can exist in general-purpose programming languages due to the increased complexity. Another reason is the use of a lot of syntactic sugar.

# Representative Quotes

> Also the magnitude of functions and syntax options can lead to a pipeline that is more difficult to read.
