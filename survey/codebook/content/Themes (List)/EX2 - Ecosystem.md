# Description

The ecosystem surrounding a language will also have an effect on how easy it is to understand artifacts created in it. These topics are included because they are interesting in general, however they can not have had an effect on the experiments because they were controlled (e.g., all participants read the source code in a custom experiment tool without syntax highlighting, not their own editor that might differ between Python and Jayvee).
