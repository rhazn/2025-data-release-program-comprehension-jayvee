# Description

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things. 
- *Phil Karlton*

Well chosen names can have a large influence on data pipeline understanding, especially for novices.

Participants generally describe names in Jayvee as fitting, especially because they cover a more limited domain and all come from the same source.

In contrast, naming in Python is perceived as inconsistent and in some cases unclear as names come from many different sources (such as external libraries) and do not use a shared glossary.
