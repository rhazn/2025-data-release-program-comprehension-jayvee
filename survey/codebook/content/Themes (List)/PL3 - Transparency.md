[[PL - Programming Language]]
# Description

Transparency relates to how much insights into the functionality participants gain by reading the source code of a data pipeline.

Differences can come from how visible implementation details are (depending on the level of abstraction a language aims for) or how much functionality can be expressed in few lines of code (called density of functionality).

Another important influence on understanding is how much automation is part of the language design, does it try to handle issues internally and return the best possible result or fail fast if not configured explicitly?
