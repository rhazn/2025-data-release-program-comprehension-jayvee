# Description

Differences in the structure of code between Jayvee and Python, both regarding the amount of structure as well as language elements related to structuring source code.

Jayvee enforces a structure considerably more strictly than Python, especially with the use of blocks that are configured in one place and then wired up using pipes. Python is less structured, allowing different coding styles from script-style programming to more structured OOP style code.
