[[PL - Programming Language]]
# Description

The amount of options and configuration opportunities have an effect on understanding. In addition to the language itself, the amount of external libraries that can be used are also a factor that influences understanding of data pipelines. 

This effect is especially relevant to the comparison of general-purpose programming languages (GPLs) with domain-specific languages (DSLs) because DSLs explicitly aim to support a subset of the functionality of a GPL in the hopes of being easier to understand.
