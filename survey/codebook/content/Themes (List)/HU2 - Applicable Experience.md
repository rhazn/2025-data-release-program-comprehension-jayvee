[[HU - Human Factors]]
# Description

In contrast to experience that is [[HU1 - Required Experience|required]] to create and read data pipelines, different forms of previous experience can influence how well a user can understand a data pipeline.

Because Jayvee is a domain-specific language, previous experience from the domain of data engineering also maps more closely to the first-level programming constructs like blocks and pipes.

Reading multiple pipelines in the same, strict structure allows for learning effects to occur - in contrast to more flexible general-purpose languages like Python.

In regard to the experiment, an influencing factor was that participants overwhelmingly had previous experience with Python and little experience with Jayvee.
