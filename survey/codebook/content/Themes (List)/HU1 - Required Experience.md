[[HU - Human Factors]]
# Description

Understanding data pipelines from source code requires experience. How much previous experience is required can vary depending on factors such as enforced structure of a language or how well names are chosen.

In addition to the reader, the experience of the author of the source code influences understanding as well. If a program is structured well and is named appropriately, it is easier to understand and vice versa.
