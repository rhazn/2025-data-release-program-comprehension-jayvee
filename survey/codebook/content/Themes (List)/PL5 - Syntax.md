[[PL - Programming Language]]
# Description

The syntax of a language emerged as an important influencing factor on understandability, especially for novices as unfamiliar syntax provides a challenge.

Participants also highlighted how syntax that can be read like english text or human-like language makes allows readers to intuitively understand program code.

Finally, the choice between expressive and verbose syntax is a trade-off with effects on understandability and speed.
