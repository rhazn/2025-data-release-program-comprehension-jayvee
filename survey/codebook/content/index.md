## Codebook

### Category [[PL - Programming Language]]

- [[PL1 - Pipeline Overview]]
    - [[PL1.1 - Information is split between pipeline overview and implementation]]
    - [[PL1.2 - Without pipeline overview, all code must be considered]]
    - [[PL1.3 - Python does not provide a pipeline overview]]
    - [[PL1.4 - Jayvee pipeline overview improves speed]]
    - [[PL1.5 - Jayvee pipeline overview helps to understand the flow of a pipeline]]
- [[PL2 - Code Structure]]
    - [[PL2.1 - Sequential structure of Jayvee]]
    - [[PL2.2 - Blocks structure improves understanding]]
    - [[PL2.3 - Encapsulation of related code in blocks or functions improves understanding]]
    - [[PL2.4 - Jayvee enforces a structure]]
    - [[PL2.5 - No clearly defined or enforced structure in Python]]
- [[PL3 - Transparency]]
    - [[PL3.1 - Hidden implementation details make understanding difficult]]
    - [[PL3.2 - Automation decreases understanding]]
    - [[PL3.3 - Interpretation blocks make outcome unclear]]
    - [[PL3.4 - Scoped code (blocks, functions) should execute one operation, not multiple]]
    - [[PL3.5 - Density of functionality effects understanding]]
- [[Themes (List)/PL4 - Amount of Options]]
    - [[PL4.1 - Amount of functionality Limited and General]]
    - [[PL4.2 - External libraries have different approaches and change]]
    - [[PL4.3 - Trade-off between customization and defaults]]
    - [[PL4.4 - Different functions to achieve the same goal decrease understanding]]
- [[PL5 - Syntax]]
    - [[PL5.1 - Syntax is important for novices]]
    - [[PL5.2 - Unfamiliar syntax makes understanding difficult]]
    - [[PL5.3 - Code can be read like english text]]
    - [[PL5.4 - Expressive and verbose syntax]]
    - [[PL5.5 - Different syntax options for the same semantic decrease understanding]]
- [[PL6 - Language Elements]]
    - [[PL6.1 - Advanced programming concepts like map are hard to understand]]
    - [[PL6.2 - Domain-specific language elements like blocks make Jayvee easy to understand]]
    - [[PL6.3 - Jayvee language elements (blocks, value types, constraints) are unusual and need to be learned]]
    - [[PL6.4 - Meta infos (e.g., imports, library names) obscure the logic of the pipeline]]
    - [[PL6.5 - Mixed effects of no variables in Jayvee]]
### Category [[HU - Human Factors]]

- [[HU1 - Required Experience]]
    - [[HU1.1 - Python is harder to understand without previous experience]]
    - [[HU1.2 - Novices profit from good naming]]
    - [[HU1.3 - Good programming habits are required to keep Python easy to understand]]
    - [[HU1.4 - Less structure can lead to hard to understand implementation]]
- [[HU2 - Applicable Experience]]
    - [[HU2.1 - Mental model of an ETL pipeline aligns with Jayvee]]
    - [[HU2.2 - No learning effect between pipelines due to low structure]]
    - [[HU2.3 - Participants had previous experience with Python]]
    - [[HU2.4 - Participants had no experience with Jayvee and its language design]]
- [[HU3 - Naming]]
    - [[HU3.1 - Jayvee names describe functionality well]]
    - [[HU3.2 - Python function names are unclear or inconsistent]]
    - [[HU3.3 - Good names for steps is important to understanding]]
### Category [[EX - External Elements]]

- [[EX1 - Documentation]]
    - [[EX1.1 - Uniform documentation structure improves speed]]
    - [[EX1.2 - Quality of documentation of Jayvee and Python]]
    - [[EX1.3 - Documentation affects understanding]]
